# Code detect
## introduction：
My goal is to involve a code detection tool. Currently, code detection tools such as MOSS are available, but due to their cumbersome download steps and deployment conditions, I hope to optimize and upgrade based on MOSS and other tools, and solve these problems. The cumbersome steps make checking duplication simple and fast, saving a lot of time.
##Compare with Moss：
1.) Include only one source file

2.) No third-party dependencies (except zss when using TreeDiff)

3.) No need to register an account

4.) Access without internet connection
# Usage: None (as simple as possible)
# Installation: (as easy as possible)
